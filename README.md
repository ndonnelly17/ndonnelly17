<h1>Hi, I'm Nichole! <br/><a href="https://github.com/ndonnelly17"></h1> 
I am a student majoring in Information Security where my goal is to become a cybersecurity professional. I have twelve years of experience in I.T. in managing helpdesks in both the transportation and banking industries.  I have extensive experience with setting up, deploying, and maintaining point-of-sale software. I was a part of many successful projects where I was responsible for QA testing and
successful implementations by maintaining the systems and providing initial and up-to-date training for all users.  I enjoy finding solutions to problems and helping people better understand and use technology.
